# TraditionalColor

UIColor+TraditionalColor is an extension of UIColor that facilitates the use of Chinese traditional colors.

This is a shorter list of traditional colors compared to others, including 19 classical colors, which is originally used in my own app.

It also supports random traditional color, name of traditional color(for display), and the corresponding readable text color.

Some of the code belongs to Colours and Chameleon Framework.

Feel free to use or change it.
